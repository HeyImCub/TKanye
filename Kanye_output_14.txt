Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?"
You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
Can we get much higher?
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(Saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it; Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever; who has it?
You blowin' up, that’s good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls
Ayo
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I'm living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-Century schizoid man)
The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece
Thinking no one man should have all that power
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, god damn it, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How 'Ye doing? I'm surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting
(So excit—so excit—so excit—so excit—)
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?
All of the lights, lights, all of the lights
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere, we are (All of the lights)
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, every night (All of the lights)
Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university
Gettin' mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Gettin' right, babe
You should go and get ya own
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
K, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
Whoa, whoa
(I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh)
(I tried to tell you but all I could say)
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
I'ma need to see your fucking hands
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: "What you gon' do now?"
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert (Yeah)
(I'm a motherfucking monster)
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, "Dutty Wine" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake"
"She on a diet," but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide (decide)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
And I'll, I'll let God decide (no)
So I, I am headed home (headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight (no, the limelight)
And I'll, I'll let God decide
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
30,000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil, so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yuugh!
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron
Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, you know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh?
Uh, uh
I love it though
I love it though, y'know?
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make up, she casually allure
Text message break ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, "This what you really wanted, huh?"
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
(Satan, Satan, Satan)
When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme", not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me? Could you be more phony?
Haven't said a word—haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?
Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Ugh!)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter
Ugh, hater talking never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was getting mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put the sights over
Getting 2Pac money, twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm making love to the angel of death
Catching feelings, never stumble, retracing my steps
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies-ladies and gentlemen
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at
And I always find, yeah, I always find
Yeah I always find something wrong
Run away from me, baby, ah, run away
Run away from me, baby
(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
Then, run away
Babe, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can
Run away from me, baby, run away
(Look at-look at-look at-look at-look at-look at-look at ya)
(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Why can't she just, run away?
Baby, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P!
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin’ life like we won the sweepstakes, what
We headed to hell for heaven’s sakes, huh
Well I’mma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah!
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin’ from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It’s kinda crazy that’s all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
One day I’m gon' marry a porn star
We’ll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We’ll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin’ to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play, 'til I roll over
I’mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin’ to on Oscar day
'specially if she can’t get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn’t rent her, they couldn’t take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, “Get away”
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the- with the lights on
Fuck with the lights on
With the- with the lights on
Fuck- Fuck with the lights
I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in a bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That’s one hell of a life
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)
Whose fault?
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right, girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls"
"All of the lights," she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied being in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game
"Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely"
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing
Ohh, my God
Baby, you done took this shit to another motherfucking level!
Now, a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this
Goddamn, Goddamn!
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never used to talk dirty, but now you God damn disgusting!
My—my God, where'd you learn that?
Look at you, motherfucking butt-ass-naked...
With them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on...
Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level!
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now! Shit!
You done went all porno on a nigga, okay? And I, and I love it...
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how... how did your pussy game come up?
I was fucking parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before!
I was in there like "Oh, shit! I never been here before!
I've never even seen this part of Pussy Town before!"
It's like you got this shit reupholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy. And when I see that nigga, I'ma thank him. I'ma buy the album, I'ma download that motherfucker, I'm-a shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch!
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
Even with the bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted!
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source!
I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source!
That's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
Where'd you learn to treat a nigga like this?
Yeezy taught you well
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm building a still, down the time
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
I'm building a still, to slow down the time
Down for the night, said she’s down for the night
Ooohh, ooohh, ooohh, ooohh
Ooohh, ooohh, ooohh, ooohh (slow down the time)
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma-ma-se, ma-ma-se, ma-ma-ku-sa
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms
Still get laid in the afterlife
Still get laid, yeah, yeah, yeah
Run from the lights, run from the night, run for your life
Down for the night, down for the night, down for the night
I'm lost in the world
Been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night, down for the night
Down for the night
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America? (Down for the night)
Who willsurvive in America?
But I'm down for the night, down for the night
Oh, oh, get down
Hey, woah-ohh, hey, woah-ohh
Hey woah-ohh, hey-hey-hey!
Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom; free-doom
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
That preceded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
"All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night"
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
I know you see me now, right now (You see me now, right now)
I know you see me now, right now (You see, you see)
I know you see me now, right now (Haha, yeah)
I know you see me now, right now
I got my suit and tie, and I don't know if y'all know
Well maybe y'all do, or maybe y'all don't
But I don't really care, it's how we on it all the time
So I'ma get my money, let's go
Now I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolatey
What's up with who? That's old news
I'm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cruise
I might walk in Nobu with no shoes
"He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you"
Immature adult, insecure asshole
If you fall on the concrete, that's your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that's your last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that your ass slow
She got a big booty but she couldn't drop it as low
'Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin' money they be all up on your ass, yo
When you gettin' money cops don't let a nigga pass, go
Straight to jail yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell 'em I said "Hello"
Ask if I'ma be there soon and tell him I said "Hell no"
Yo what you say when your people get outta jail, huh?
My niggas is home
I guess I got everything, everything I want
(Let's go shopping, dog, let's celebrate)
But I don’t, no matter how good it gets, it’ll never be like before
(Free Weezy though)
No women in the crowd, screamin' and it’s loud
Doin' things not allowed and I swear it’s going down right now
(You know what it is)
I know one thing, my mama would be proud
And you see me lookin' up
'Cause I know she’s lookin' down right now
I know you see me now right now
Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now I’m in the Louvre, lookin' for fossils
'Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells, it’s so un-Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Barneys
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic: 32
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder Ye
'Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
I got style, ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty’s swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here’s somethin' that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a child’s illusions become reality
Now go get my throne, 'cause I don’t wanna stop
I just go in my zone, and I’ma make it hot 'til it’s time to go
When it’s time to go, where you tryna go?
You better act like you can see me now
Exactly
Rosewood
Aha, aha
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D
Man, today I am the freshest in the world, but that's the obvious
Damn, I look so sexy, and you look like a pile of shit
When I told my ex I love her, she went and married another
And changed her whole name up, you a Yugoslavi' chick
"Be successful," that's what Dad told me
So everything I D-O, now I OD
They say G.O.O.D. Music like the new Miami Heat, shit

Presidential suit, my girls Michelle and Chanel
She gave me designer, uh, she keep it au natural
I say it again, I'm chasin' cheese, dodgin' rat traps
Chasin' pussy you might end up with a Kat Stacks
Nasty trick, you's a nasty chick
Ooh, you know I like that nasty shit
Got it made in every way, gettin' paid every day
What Sean sound like, 'Ye protégé?
He sound like he a pro to me
"I know Kanye a jerk," how could you say that?
He rode me and my mama 'round in his Maybach
What kind of jerk is that? What kind of jerks is y'all?
Fuck it if he a jerk, I bet you jerk him off
Bet you take it off or chase him through the mall
We workin' twice as hard, so everything come in twos
Double drinks, double girls

Hahahahaha
Yeah, Lex Luger, No ID, Yeezy
Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleep (Less in June) or (Missing you)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will
Mrs. So Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon
Don't say you will, you do
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Don't say you will, if you will, I pray you will
I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you
Please say you will, for real, I pray you will
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card, card
And all I got was a brand new sports car, oh
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)
I can't stop having these visions
Dad cracked a joke, all the kids laughed
But I couldn't hear him all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?
I've seen it, I've seen it before
My god-sister getting married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I'd wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak
Ooh-hoo
And I, and I can't stop
No, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no
No, can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it
Ooh, ooh, oooh
Hoo-hoo, ho-ho-hoo
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me
In the night, I hear 'em talk (Me)
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night
How could you be so heartless? (How, how?)
On and on and on and on
And on and, and on and on and on
It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong, yeah
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved
And no matter what, you'll never take that from me
I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in, never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of
I'm amazing (Amazing) yeah I'm all that (All that)
If I ain't on my grind, then what you call that? (What you call that?)
Victorious, yeah we warriors
We make history, strive off victory (Yeah)
Standing at my podium, I'm trying to watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure, either let the Feds catch ya (Yeah)
I'm amazing, born on a full moon
