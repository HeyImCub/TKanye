(Are we out of the woods?!)
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started cryin', baby, I did, too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me,
I remember, oh, I remember
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road
Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay
Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye
Let me remind
You this was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stayI stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
I go on too many dates [chuckle]
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
You could've been getting down to this sick beat.
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "Oh, my god!" but I'm just gonna shake.
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah ohhh
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (and fake, and fake, and fake)
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you've got to),
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it offIt's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said
I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would
It's 2 AM in my room.
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you.
We're a crooked love in a straight line down.
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish.
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish...
2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
But it made us turn right back around
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore.
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I
Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey)
You say sorry just for show (hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey)
Mhmmm
If you love like that blood runs cold
You know it used to be mad love (mad love)
And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them)
(Hey)
So take a look what you've done (look what you've done)
HeyHe said, "Let's get out of this town,
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds."
I thought heaven can't help me now.
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh,
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.
I said, "No one has to know what we do, "
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound,
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is
You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Even if it's just pretend
Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh
(Even if it's just in your wildest dreams) ah-ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha.Oh oh oh.
Oh-oh.
Stand there like a ghost shaking from the rain (rain).
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane ('ane)?"
Say it's been a long 6 months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want.
And that's how it works.
That's how you get the girl.
And then you say,
"I want you for worse or for better,
I would wait forever and ever,
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
I would wait forever and ever."
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...
Oh.
Remind her how it used to be (yeah, yeah)
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks (cheeks)
Tell her how you must have lost your mind. (uh-uh)
When you left her all alone, and never told her why (why).
That's how you lost the girl.
And now you say,
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever),
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together (together).
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever)."
It's how you get the girl, girl... (Yeah, yeah)
And you could know (oh-oh oh oh)
That I don't want you to go oh-oh..
Remind me how it used to be.
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks.
And say you want me.
Yeah...
"I want you for worse or for better (for worse or for better),
I want you forever and ever."
It's how you get the girl, girl.
That's how it works.
That's how you got the girl.Clear blue water, high tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams,
in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me
Tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you
But you're still gone, gone, gone
Been losing grip,
oh, sinking ships
You showed up just in time
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
This love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]
Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When you're young you just run
But you come back to what you need
This love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]You stand with your hand on my waist line
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out
Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
I know places
They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
And you know for me, it's always you
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
And I know for you, it's always me
I know placesThe drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Hung my head as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean
There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
And by morning, gone was any trace of you,
Said I think I am finally clean
10 months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
10 months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it
The drought was the very worst
And by morning gone was any trace of you
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Think I'm finally cleanFlashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole.
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
I'm spinning out of control.
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night.
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed.
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams.
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind.
But darling, we found wonderland
I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You search the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad.
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever)
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better (never better)
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland)
In wonderlandOne look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back
Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
You felt enough
You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love
Morning, his place
Burn toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says
You're my best friend
And you knew what it was
He is in love
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe round and round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words
'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You're in love
You're in loveWe're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
The best people in life are free
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true
So come on, come along with me
Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded,
It's so romantic
The best people in life are freeThe way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough
The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me
wahooahoo
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything
There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive
The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for meAll the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
Outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
Faster than my bullet
Ellen works a long day
Giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater
And it gets kinda weird
Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend
But it's not cause were just sitting here
And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
And it's always gonna get weird
Cause this song is all about Ellen
Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen
Always end up dancing
I've been on this show
Eight times now and I still remember
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could of died
She's always asks me who I'm dating
Every time I'm on this show
And I don't even know why
But it gets five million hits on youtube
Cause, Every single time I come on this show
Always end up dancingI wake up, I stretch out
I wonder what you're doing right now
Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
Tell myself I must be crazy,
Thinking about him
I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you I'd be
A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter
No one wrote
I go to work, work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
Walk to my car, dig out my keys
Start thinking if you were with anyone but me
There you are, on the street
Standing there all waiting on me
Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
You say you love em, and baby without you,
I'd be
I wake up, I stretch out
Wonder what you're doing right nowSometimes I wonder how it's gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love
I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other
It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love that's gonna last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for loveAmerican boy, living life as it goes
Sittin' on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the hope of an american boy
Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an american beauty
suddenly he cheats, sent from above
the dream of an american boy
American boy, raising little babies
hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
that's grown up, american boy
growing up on Grandview avenue
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
the hope of an american boyWell, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was gonna keep
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl
Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach
Oh, take it easy now
She was an American girlAngelinas got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
Ive never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I dont cause
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say
I wasnt brought up that way
Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
Hes got everything youd wanna be
Hes funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I wont cause
Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But aint it funny how
It all comes out
Isnt life sweet?
And Im not, Im not oh
I wasnt brought up that wayI like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah
I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you mean,
Do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever
Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
I like the way you'd hold me
I like the way you'd sing to me
Do you say,
Do you say what you mean?
Oh, yeah, yeah
You'd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever
But I'd rather you be mean
And I'd rather take a blow
Now baby don't you break my heart
Slow[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Hey! I can't take it back, look where I'm at!
We was on D like DOC, remember that? (Remember that)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
And I don't think we can solve 'em
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Hey! Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need yah
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia?
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
If you live like that you live with ghosts
(Think we can solve 'em!)
(Look what you've done)
Now we've got problems
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
and sometimes I think of you late at night
I don't know why
i want to be somewhere where you are
I want to be where...
You're here, You're eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes
I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while... I'll cry
Cause you're my lullaby
SO baby come hold me tight cause I-I
I want to be everything you need
Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, Eyes...Beautiful eyesAll is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby
Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet
Look at what we've found
So turn that car around
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my babyHer hair is Harlow gold, her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn the music on you, you won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow, she got Bette Davis eyes
And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll let you take her home, it whets her appetite
She'll lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice
Until you come up blue, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you, when she snows you
Hope you'll feed with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll tease you, she'll unease you
Just to please you, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you when she snows you
She knows you, she's got Bette Davis EyesI live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off,
you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better
We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't wanna come down
But they make it so tough
'Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know betterHere you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you'd want to know
That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again
When you feel the world is crashing
I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again
BreathlessEmily comes home from school,
Grabs onto her daddy's hand,
He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
She says, "Please, don't make me go back there again."
She said, "I wish there was some way
To make them stop it."
So he drives down to
That principles office and says,
"I didn't bring her up
So they could cut her down.
I didn't bring her here
So they could shut her out.
I live my whole damn life
To see that little girl's smile.
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way."
Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time,
She doesn't have too much to say
She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do."
And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you."
And he said,
"I didn't bring you up
So he could wear you down.
Take that innocent heart
And turn it inside out.
To see my little girl's smile.
So don't let nobody take that away.
You weren't brought up that way."
The phone rings on a rainy night
Says, "It's officer Tate."
He said, "Sir, there's been an accident.
You better come down here right away.
A drunken driver missed an over pass.
And Emily  she's fading fast."
He says, "God, I didn't bring her up
To watch them lay her down.
Nearly killed me the day
They put her momma in the ground.
Only thing that kept me alive
Was that little girl's smile.
So please don't take that away.
It won't be easy taking her today.
He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyesI had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room
Holding her hand
I'd have never guessed
That starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off
And by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
I should've let you know
All the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat
And make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing
And come over here to say
I'm looking good
But by the way
You still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
If you ever wondered
Still got the same old number; just in case
I still miss you
And i still love you
By the way, ohAny day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're gonna be
You say, this crazy world's come undone
Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today
Everyday now they're talking war
& I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well thats good enough for me
Dont need the real thing
Thats just another thing
For me to try to tame
Dont know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see me
Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But Ill never look
At a sunset the same night
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
Youll see meI'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly
But I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe
Baby you showed me what living is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
Oh oh
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
Crazier, crazier.Ive been counting days and
Ive been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above
I dont want to jinx my luck
Ive left it all behind me
And Ive been hoping every day
That someday you will find me
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
Dreaming of you baby
Ive been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
Cause Ive been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you
Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if youve seen one
Id like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one
I cross my heart and hope for you tonightHe said, "I got me a nice new apartment
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with."
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee
He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,
She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note
In dark blue TennesseeShe walks to school with her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o'clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried
Didn't she call you?
Didn't she need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too
He kissed his wife good bye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle three men walked and said,
"We're here to die for our God."
He stood up and said, "That's funny,
'Cause my God died for me."
I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
Didn't he call you?
Didn't he need you bad enough?
Did you not write it down?
Where were you?
And didn't he pray too?
The taxis pulled up on the very day of
They rode 100 floors up just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the towers up in flames
There was nothing left to say when it all came down
And didn't they call you?
Didn't they need you bad enough?
Where were you? Where were you?
And didn't they pray too?
I walk to school and I wear a cross
I'm counting every dayMy momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
