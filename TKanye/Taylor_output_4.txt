And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why
I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, cos she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough
That's where I'm headed right now
I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there
But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
I just drive on by
I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night, just south of knowing whyI got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it'd be a long time going
They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going
I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you
A long time going
And it will be a long time, long time going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
It will be a long time, long time going, going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ohCome on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose
Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside
He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine
I never talked about the nights he called
I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind
Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went outThere's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You could do better, that's what she says
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you
She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, that's what she says
And she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you
Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey she'll love you, funny how some view
Angels above you ain't so far away
And she says lucky you, lucky youYour feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You
You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got
I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good
Made Up You
Made Up YouHe's got a nice little life
He's gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
It's not the best I know
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine
People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin
Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah
Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh, mandolinMe and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney
We were babies, we were beautiful and free
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney
She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasnt been the same since
That boy she went ran off with, well I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney
She was in love, she was beautiful and free
She was always so much braver than me
When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said Im sorry for waking you up but I didnt know who else to call
Or where else to go
Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney
Were not as young, but were still beautiful and free
Even when were old, were still gonna be
Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear in the summer shadeI like glitter and sparkly dresses,
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter,
La la la, la la la
I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me,
But I'm not gonna say that
I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public,
La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue
You might think I'd bring up Joe,
The guy who broke up with me on the phone,
But I'm not gonna mention him
Hey Joe! I'm doing real well,
Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not gonna brag about that
La la la, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
And if you're wondering if I might,
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight,
(Hi Taylor!)
I'm not gonna comment on that
You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue.....
But there's nothing more to say
Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining this stage
This is my SNL monologue
That was my SNL monologueI know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better
All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you
If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
if you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure
wherever you think I am tonight
just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby
sometime along the way you take my breath away
distracted by he view
I fall right into you
and if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure
they say I need to see all the people out there waiting
but you take one look at me
and I know the mistake I'd be making
cuz if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure
I know we've got a lot to say between now and foreverSomething about me didn't fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I haven't read it a thousand times
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me
You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
She'll still sing the same old songs
Turned on that radio
Hey that's when I realized
It wasn't our song, it was yours
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than
It's my turn to be meOn a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, it's quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by
You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress
Blowing through a mountain
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July
And its safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you
Thinking bout the whole thing
Blowing though a valley
I'm going back to Nashville
Blowing through the valley
Going back to Naaaaahh....
What's the use of wondering why?I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called
I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My worlds a little colder now
But Im keeping warm somehow
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you
I dont need you dont need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street
You need me now
Thats what youve been telling my friends
That Ive come too far to go back there again
My heart my mind and number have changed
You might as well forget my name
I dont need you dont need you
Red letters that I wrote on the wall
So whos gonna hold you
I dont need you now
And I dont know where you are
I dont wonder where you are
I dont dream about you cause I dont need you now
I dont dream about the way
That I never heard you say
I need you I need you
Dont need you
Dont need you nowI think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade
Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now that's broken too
Everybody else was everything to you
You think everybody wants a fight
I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
You've seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do
Never fadeLook at you
Look at me
Look at who we could be
I wanna know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you
And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind
All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you
And look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
All I really wanna say is I need you, babe
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
And I just wish I told you never mind
And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
Yeah, oh yeah
I could tell you now but never mind
Yeah, oh yeah yeah
And I could tell you now but never mindIt wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
When there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I, I still love you but I can't
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah
The picture frame is empty
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
I was so sure of everything we thought we'd always have
I'm lost in the sound of it
But here in the now comes in
Seems like I'm becoming part of your past
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you like your slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah
There was one thing I knew would never leave me
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skinStanding on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again
And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can
Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind
Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out
Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everythingOh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was fallin'
You were holdin' my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I coulda spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were callin my name
When your face faded from view
Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin" out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night
I remember waking up with you
The days doin' nothin'
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you
Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?
And stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises you made on Our last night?
Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like harold and martin singing
I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane
Was it just like the promises that we made?
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
Oh,oh,oh,whoa,whoa,yeaah, ohI know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
'cause I'm not trying to show maturity
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker
I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess
He found 30 other pieces
But he'll never find them all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall
And I don't appreciate you calling him to reminisce
The only reason is you're seeing how much better off he is
To write on his heart
Oh, permanent markerI could've keyed your car
I could've rolled your yard
I know the passwords to your emails, everything you do
I could've put 'em to good use
But I'm dressed to kill and tonight I'm going out on a date
With your best friend, he always liked me anyway
R-E-V-E-N-G-E My list of things to do this week
Jealousy, misery, gonna give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so B-A-D
Break you, make you sorry
I hope you cry getting my R-E-V-E-N-G-E
So I'm gonna paint the town with him
Replace your memory, everywhere we've ever been
I don't hangout at smokey bars but I know we'll see you there
And I'm making you hear me laugh like I just don't care
I know you hate my friends so tonight I called 'em all
Later on you can expect some prank phone calls, baby
S-A-N-I-T-Y, I hope you lose yours tonight
You made me crazy too long
So I'm working on
Baby, baby R-E-V-E-N-G-E
Gonna give you what you gave to meI was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams
Oh, and they come unstuck
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf
I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
Oh lady, running down to the riptide
I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrongI remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear
Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?
I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and backI remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Don't you dare look out your window darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
La La (La La)
Come morning light,
You and I'll be safe and sound...
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh oh ohLet's watch
The tide chase
The waves
Onto the sand
I wonder
If a broken heart
Feel the warmth
On my hand
And I wonder
What a piece
Of driftwood
Has seen all through
His lifetime
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights
I've seen
A million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want
To speak to you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights
Still throught
The haze
I can make out
Constellations
I'll make one
Of you and me
As we sit
In the sand
And I saw
That sunset gleamin
As my eyes went wild
I've played
A thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
To sing to you
Waited on a wire
Starin' at the fire
I've walked
A thousand miles
Smiled
A thousand smiles
Now I only smile
When I'm with you
So walk with me
As the sweet
Wind dances
I'll write a song
For you and me
Smokey black nightsDays go by, I wonder if you here me
Can't you read between the lines?
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing
Take this chance, I'll make you mine
Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside
But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you
He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides
Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it
And all I see is youLet me know, how's it feel
To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy
I have been looking in, trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside
Why the hell don't you love me?
What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
You take one look at me, 'cause that's what it cost.
I was gonna be everything you need
'Cause you're everything to me
Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skinTire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Whistle County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet
You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you
Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times
I remember.........
Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was,
"Hey, how have you been?"
You caught me with that old smile
Said, "It's really been a while,
And I still think about back when.."
We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeahHit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "No"
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever
There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along."
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever
There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
This lifesweeter than fiction, fiction
I'll be one of the many saying,
"Look at you now, look at you now, now."
"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud."
And when they call your name
and they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "No"
Now in this perfect weather
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)
There you'll stand next to me
It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter than, sweeter
Sweeter than fictionIt was something like a perfect start to
This love yesterday but now who are you
I thought I knew
Your eyes how to know to look right through me
It's like you forgot the words you whispered to me
They weren't true
It's like it wasn't you
Could you tell me what did I do
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me
Take time to realize I know
That people change their minds
But that was something I wished you would say
To my face
But you run away
If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
Baby even a lie
Yeah Yeah
Tell me what did I do
Because baby suddenly we're already through
And tell me
Ooooh Yeah
Tell MeYou were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a half
Everybody said that you were bad news
but baby I was betting on you
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes
Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down
Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me
Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six packIm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring
Kinda girl
Hey yeah whats the word on you
Lay low Im a mission rebel
Angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental
But here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
Im poetry, complicated
Simply stated
Hey yeah baby how about you
I was born free
Im a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up I dont get up
I just get down yeah
Its raining on Sunday
Theres nothing on TV
Yesterday was lonely
Youre the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I cant stop thinking about you
I bet youre thinking of me too
Well here I am an open book
Yeah here I am an open book
To the diary of meShould have been different but
It wasn't different, was it
Same old story, dear john,
And so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't
There's your trouble,
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you,
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
So now you're thinking 'bout
All you're missing how
Deep you're sinking,
Round and round and dragging down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss,
Chalk it up better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that dont offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go
These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if theyre half as stubborn as me
Theyll just keep on shining bright
I aint ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling aint strong
Ill just move on
And leave this in my past
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Ill act today
Until you find somebody new
So Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it
Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still dont know
Oh and it troubles me so
Wondering love how Ill feel today
I see you found somebody new
And Ive been holding on
I might miss you bad but
Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smileWalking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar
It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar
Were you a present from a father to a son
Did he forget you
Or just play you 'til you came undone
Hey did some prima donna love you
'Til she got her fame and fortune
I won't do that to you
Nice to meet you, I can teach you
All I know, you can show me what you do
And I played you for endless hours
Never left you in the corner
You're my one and only friend
Now I know where life lessons are
You're my guitar
This here guitarBeneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
Its like Im melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
and
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening
Could this be better?
You write me letters
So you see me everyday
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away
Lock me up in a dark room
And I still cant take my eyes off you
All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh Baby,Here we are
Oh,This is really happening
Oh,Oh,Baby
Youll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh,that this is really happening
Tell me,Oh
(need me,tell me)
(Baby)
(Oh)
That this is really happening[T-Pain:]
Hey Hey, T-Swizzle {T-Swizzle}
And T-Pizzle {T-Pizzle}
I'm like 8 foot 4
Blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangster you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delight
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?
I had a dream last night
I had high top Nikes
I had
Diamonds in my mouth
And Diamonds on my mic
By the time I woke I was singing
I'm on a boat, whoa oh
Cause I'm a singer turned rapper
Shorty I'm a make ya
Straight to the top, yo
Shorty I'm a take ya
You can call me T-Sweezy
Now I'm a rap star
Hey, It's a thug story
Now tell 'em who you are
Singer turned gangster
You don't want to fight me
Straight to the top
In my extra small white tee
T-Swift and T-Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story now can you get with that?
What, What, I knit sweaters, yo!
What, What, Don't test me (Beep)
Hey, Hold on, hold on
I didn't even say anything I- (What?)
I said Yo (yup)
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't swear (She didn't even swear)
Hello? Ugh!Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see.
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
