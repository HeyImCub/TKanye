I'll make one
Of you and me
As we sit
In the sand
And I saw
That sunset gleamin
As my eyes went wild
I've played
A thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
To sing to you
Waited on a wire
Starin' at the fire
I've walked
A thousand miles
Smiled
A thousand smiles
Now I only smile
When I'm with you
So walk with me
As the sweet
Wind dances
I'll write a song
For you and me
Smokey black nightsDays go by, I wonder if you here me
Can't you read between the lines?
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing
Take this chance, I'll make you mine
Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside
But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you
He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides
Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it
And all I see is youLet me know, how's it feel
To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy
I have been looking in, trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside
Why the hell don't you love me?
What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
You take one look at me, 'cause that's what it cost.
I was gonna be everything you need
'Cause you're everything to me
Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skinTire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Whistle County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet
You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you
Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times
I remember.........
Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was,
"Hey, how have you been?"
You caught me with that old smile
Said, "It's really been a while,
And I still think about back when.."
We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeahHit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "No"
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever
There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along."
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever
There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
This lifesweeter than fiction, fiction
I'll be one of the many saying,
"Look at you now, look at you now, now."
"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud."
And when they call your name
and they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "No"
Now in this perfect weather
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)
There you'll stand next to me
It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter than, sweeter
Sweeter than fictionIt was something like a perfect start to
This love yesterday but now who are you
I thought I knew
Your eyes how to know to look right through me
It's like you forgot the words you whispered to me
They weren't true
It's like it wasn't you
Could you tell me what did I do
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me
Take time to realize I know
That people change their minds
But that was something I wished you would say
To my face
But you run away
If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
Baby even a lie
Yeah Yeah
Tell me what did I do
Because baby suddenly we're already through
And tell me
Ooooh Yeah
Tell MeYou were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a half
Everybody said that you were bad news
but baby I was betting on you
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes
Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down
Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me
Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six packIm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring
Kinda girl
Hey yeah whats the word on you
Lay low Im a mission rebel
Angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental
But here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
Im poetry, complicated
Simply stated
Hey yeah baby how about you
I was born free
Im a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up I dont get up
I just get down yeah
Its raining on Sunday
Theres nothing on TV
Yesterday was lonely
Youre the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I cant stop thinking about you
I bet youre thinking of me too
Well here I am an open book
Yeah here I am an open book
To the diary of meShould have been different but
It wasn't different, was it
Same old story, dear john,
And so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't
There's your trouble,
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you,
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
So now you're thinking 'bout
All you're missing how
Deep you're sinking,
Round and round and dragging down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss,
Chalk it up better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that dont offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go
These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if theyre half as stubborn as me
Theyll just keep on shining bright
I aint ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling aint strong
Ill just move on
And leave this in my past
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Ill act today
Until you find somebody new
So Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it
Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still dont know
Oh and it troubles me so
Wondering love how Ill feel today
I see you found somebody new
And Ive been holding on
I might miss you bad but
Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smileWalking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar
It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar
Were you a present from a father to a son
Did he forget you
Or just play you 'til you came undone
Hey did some prima donna love you
'Til she got her fame and fortune
I won't do that to you
Nice to meet you, I can teach you
All I know, you can show me what you do
And I played you for endless hours
Never left you in the corner
You're my one and only friend
Now I know where life lessons are
You're my guitar
This here guitarBeneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
Its like Im melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
and
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening
Could this be better?
You write me letters
So you see me everyday
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away
Lock me up in a dark room
And I still cant take my eyes off you
All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh Baby,Here we are
Oh,This is really happening
Oh,Oh,Baby
Youll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh,that this is really happening
Tell me,Oh
(need me,tell me)
(Baby)
(Oh)
That this is really happening[T-Pain:]
Hey Hey, T-Swizzle {T-Swizzle}
And T-Pizzle {T-Pizzle}
I'm like 8 foot 4
Blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangster you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delight
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?
I had a dream last night
I had high top Nikes
I had
Diamonds in my mouth
And Diamonds on my mic
By the time I woke I was singing
I'm on a boat, whoa oh
Cause I'm a singer turned rapper
Shorty I'm a make ya
Straight to the top, yo
Shorty I'm a take ya
You can call me T-Sweezy
Now I'm a rap star
Hey, It's a thug story
Now tell 'em who you are
Singer turned gangster
You don't want to fight me
Straight to the top
In my extra small white tee
T-Swift and T-Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story now can you get with that?
What, What, I knit sweaters, yo!
What, What, Don't test me (Beep)
Hey, Hold on, hold on
I didn't even say anything I- (What?)
I said Yo (yup)
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't swear (She didn't even swear)
Hello? Ugh!Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see.
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said "my point exactly"
And later on that night, under the neon city lights,
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me.
You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring
And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
'Cause they don't play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
'Til Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah, oh oh
Until Brad Pitt comes alongToday was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense until the time I saw your face
Yeah yeah
But can you feel this magic in the air?
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Today was a fairytaleAre you trying to make me fall
'Cause with a face like that baby
It won't take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while I'll be hypnotized
Sitting here singing
Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head
Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up
I was all caught up
'Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me
See the train is coming for me
Help me, save me from this crash at last
Na na na na na na na na na
You seem to be just what I've tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Ooh, ooh I really really want you
Oh, oh I love you I love you
Oh, oh..
Trying to get my heels back under my headI used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemys eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!
One minute I held the keys
Next the doors were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I cant explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldnt believe what Id become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king?
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
But that was when I ruled the worldIf you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me
If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
You'd be with me, so baby
Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me
It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall
But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby
You go, I hope you think of me
This girl is begging wait, wait for me
We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to
So don't you look in my eyes
Don't you look now
Don't you look nowWe used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy
I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And Goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy
Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
We Were Happy
And you were gonna marry me
When we were happy
Yeah, We were were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We Were happyI got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy
When I let too much go
Loves a little messy and you are too
Right now Im scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasnt gonna stray
Swore Id never let a man in my way
Youre the last thing I needed today
And I dont know
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Gone and spilled my coffee
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Cant talk to my friends
Without you coming up
Its even kind of cute
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good
Right next to mine
Youre the last thing I needed tonight
Welcome distraction
Im acting like a girl
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring
About anything but you
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh ohWhat do you say, when you just know
That he's the one, and you wanna go fast
But he's taking it slow
And what do you do, when he's next to you
But he's a little bit shy
Well here's something you can try
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?
What do you see, when you look in his eyes
There's something there
That he can't disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel, when you know its real
And you can't sit still
If you don't own up will yeah
My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say
What do you say?She's looking in the mirror
The moment's getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk
School dance, first chance
Always been a dreamer
There's one guy, she's shy
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it
Blue dress, angel face
Looking in the mirror
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air
Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear
She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
She's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life
First date, can't wait
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's looking right at her
Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt
The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
Move out, find out
Where the world can take her
Bright lights, late nights
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer
Ohh, oh, oh
Wondering what to wearYou walk in here with your guitar man
Your shining boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you've got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands
But don't ruin yourself I ain't your competition
Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention
I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been
I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words i wrote down on a page,
When i was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues,
I tell them, "this is what I do"
And its what i put my life into,
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume
And say life on musical road is rough conditions
But the easy ride was never my ambition
Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games
So what have you got that I ain't?
And what can you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you wanna be, girl, and who I've always beenI can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why did you have to look so good?
Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you
I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds
And if you ever change your mind
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in
That I'm really ok cause I'm not
I'll just wait for the day
I stop pretending
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Till I do,
I'll keep writing songs about youI bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything
If you want hard to get
If you want...
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one'll be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes
It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
but for someone like you it's just so easy to do
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room
And i know that if i turn around you won't be there
If i close my eyes will you be there?
I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face
I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And i hope it never falls
And i hope i never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now i wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?
That girl in the song had it so good
I wish i could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And i had you
﻿[Chorus]
Sing every hour (Every hour, 'til the power)
Every minute (Every minute, of the Lord)
Every second (Every second, comes)
Sing each and every millisecond (Down)
We need you (We need you, sing 'til the power)
We need you (We need you, of the Lord)
We need you (Comes)
Oh, we need you (Down)

Sing 'til the power of the Lord comes down
Sing 'til the power of the Lord comes down (Let everything that have breath praise God)
Sing 'til the power of the Lord comes down ('Cause when we sing the glory of the Lord comes down, down)
Sing 'til the power of the Lord comes down (Praising the Lord, praise God in the sanctuary)
Sing 'til the power of the Lord comes down (For His mighty works and excellent grace and His mighty power, yeah)
Sing 'til the power of the Lord comes down (Sing 'til the power of the Lord falls down)
Sing 'til the power of the Lord comes down (We are to sing 'til the power of the Lord comes down)
Sing 'til the power of the Lord comes down (Let us sing, let us sing, oh, sing)
God is King, we the soldiers
Ultrabeam out the solar
When I get to Heaven's gates
I ain’t gotta peek over
Keepin' perfect composure
When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I’m just focused
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
Pour the lean out slower
Got us clean out of soda
Before the flood, people judge
They did the same thing to Noah
Everybody wanted Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But the strong start on Sunday
Won't be in bondage to any man
John 8:33
We the descendants of Abraham
Ye should be made free
John 8:36
To whom the son set free is free indeed
He saved a wretch like me
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, He is wonderful
If you woke, then wake up
With Judas, kiss and make up
Even with the bitter cup
Forgave my brothers and drank up
Did everything but gave up
Stab my back, I can't front
Still we win, we prayed up
Even when we die, we raise up (Hallelujah)
Ain't no wantin', no, we need it
The powers that be done been greedy
We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty
We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth
We goin' wild, we on the loose
People is lying, we are the truth
Everything old shall now become new
The leaves’ll be green, bearing the fruit
Love God and our neighbor, as written in Luke
The army of God and we are the truth
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo
Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad (Stretch my hands to You)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"
Closed on Sunday, you're my Chick-fil-A
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
Hold the selfies, put the 'Gram away
Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray
When you got daughters, always keep 'em safe
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate
You're my number one, with the lemonade
Raise our sons, train them in the faith
Through temptations, make sure they're wide awake
Follow Jesus, listen and obey
No more livin' for the culture, we nobody's slave
Stand up for my home
Even if I take this walk alone
I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own
I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand
They will think twice steppin' onto my land
I draw the line, it's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'
Now, back up off my family, move your hands
I got my weapons in the spirit's land
I, Jezebel don't even stand a chance
Jezebel don't even stand a chance
Chick-fil-A
Yo, Pi'erre, yo, Pi'erre
"How you get so much favor on your side?"
"Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour," I replied
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, not divide
I'ma ride, that's on God
His light shine the brightest in the dark
Single mothers know they got my heart
And all my brothers locked up on the yard
You can still be anything you wanna be
Went from one in four to one in three
Thirteenth amendment, gotta end it, that's on me
He the new commander and the chief
That's on Keef, that's on God
Before the ranch, I had horses in the garage
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage
They had me chasin' statues, that's on pride
"Oh my God," Bust said that's on Tribe
When I thought the Book of Job was a job
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie
Life gon' have some lows and some highs
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod
I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn't hide
In '03, they told me not to drive
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died
But I survived, that's on God
I've been tellin' y'all since '05
The greatest artist restin' or alive
That's on L.A. Reid, that's on Clive
That's no Jive, that's on God
Off the 350s He supplied
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe
Man, that's over half of the pie
I felt dry, that's on God
That's why I charge the prices that I charge
I can't be out here dancin' with the stars
No, I cannot let my family starve
I go hard, that's on God
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Okay, okay, okay, okay
We began after the storm inside
Lay the land (Ah), it's just the morning light (Woo, woo)
Woo, woo, oh yeah
Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh
Switch your⁠, switch your attitude
Go 'head, level up yourself
This that different latitude
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Life too short, go spoil yourself
Feel that feel, enjoy yourself 'cause
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh)
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, woah)
We have everything we need
Lay the land (Ah), it's just the morning light (Oh, yeah)
Switch my, switch my attitude
I'm so, I'm so radical
All these people mad at dude
This for who it matter to
What if Eve made apple juice?
You gon' do what Adam do?
Or say, "Baby, let's put this back on the tree" 'cause
Lay the land (Ah), it's just the morning light
Well, right
So, so well
So, so
High as the sun come out
Plannin'
Bootin'
Movin'
Tubin', there
Well, well
Clean us like the rain in spring
Take the chlorine out our conversation
Let Your light reflect on me
I promise I'm not hiding anything
It's water
We are water
Pure as water
