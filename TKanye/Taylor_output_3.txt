The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me
wahooahoo
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything
There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive
The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for meAll the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
Outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
Faster than my bullet
Ellen works a long day
Giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater
And it gets kinda weird
Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend
But it's not cause were just sitting here
And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
And it's always gonna get weird
Cause this song is all about Ellen
Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen
Always end up dancing
I've been on this show
Eight times now and I still remember
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could of died
She's always asks me who I'm dating
Every time I'm on this show
And I don't even know why
But it gets five million hits on youtube
Cause, Every single time I come on this show
Always end up dancingI wake up, I stretch out
I wonder what you're doing right now
Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
Tell myself I must be crazy,
Thinking about him
I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you I'd be
A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter
No one wrote
I go to work, work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
Walk to my car, dig out my keys
Start thinking if you were with anyone but me
There you are, on the street
Standing there all waiting on me
Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
You say you love em, and baby without you,
I'd be
I wake up, I stretch out
Wonder what you're doing right nowSometimes I wonder how it's gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love
I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other
It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love that's gonna last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for loveAmerican boy, living life as it goes
Sittin' on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the hope of an american boy
Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an american beauty
suddenly he cheats, sent from above
the dream of an american boy
American boy, raising little babies
hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
that's grown up, american boy
growing up on Grandview avenue
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
the hope of an american boyWell, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was gonna keep
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl
Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach
Oh, take it easy now
She was an American girlAngelinas got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
Ive never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I dont cause
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say
I wasnt brought up that way
Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
Hes got everything youd wanna be
Hes funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I wont cause
Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But aint it funny how
It all comes out
Isnt life sweet?
And Im not, Im not oh
I wasnt brought up that wayI like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah
I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you mean,
Do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever
Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
I like the way you'd hold me
I like the way you'd sing to me
Do you say,
Do you say what you mean?
Oh, yeah, yeah
You'd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever
But I'd rather you be mean
And I'd rather take a blow
Now baby don't you break my heart
Slow[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Hey! I can't take it back, look where I'm at!
We was on D like DOC, remember that? (Remember that)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
And I don't think we can solve 'em
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Hey! Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need yah
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia?
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
If you live like that you live with ghosts
(Think we can solve 'em!)
(Look what you've done)
Now we've got problems
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
and sometimes I think of you late at night
I don't know why
i want to be somewhere where you are
I want to be where...
You're here, You're eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes
I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while... I'll cry
Cause you're my lullaby
SO baby come hold me tight cause I-I
I want to be everything you need
Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, Eyes...Beautiful eyesAll is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby
Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet
Look at what we've found
So turn that car around
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my babyHer hair is Harlow gold, her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn the music on you, you won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow, she got Bette Davis eyes
And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll let you take her home, it whets her appetite
She'll lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice
Until you come up blue, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you, when she snows you
Hope you'll feed with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll tease you, she'll unease you
Just to please you, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you when she snows you
She knows you, she's got Bette Davis EyesI live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off,
you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better
We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't wanna come down
But they make it so tough
'Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know betterHere you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you'd want to know
That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again
When you feel the world is crashing
I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again
BreathlessEmily comes home from school,
Grabs onto her daddy's hand,
He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
She says, "Please, don't make me go back there again."
She said, "I wish there was some way
To make them stop it."
So he drives down to
That principles office and says,
"I didn't bring her up
So they could cut her down.
I didn't bring her here
So they could shut her out.
I live my whole damn life
To see that little girl's smile.
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way."
Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time,
She doesn't have too much to say
She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do."
And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you."
And he said,
"I didn't bring you up
So he could wear you down.
Take that innocent heart
And turn it inside out.
To see my little girl's smile.
So don't let nobody take that away.
You weren't brought up that way."
The phone rings on a rainy night
Says, "It's officer Tate."
He said, "Sir, there's been an accident.
You better come down here right away.
A drunken driver missed an over pass.
And Emily  she's fading fast."
He says, "God, I didn't bring her up
To watch them lay her down.
Nearly killed me the day
They put her momma in the ground.
Only thing that kept me alive
Was that little girl's smile.
So please don't take that away.
It won't be easy taking her today.
He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyesI had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room
Holding her hand
I'd have never guessed
That starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off
And by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
I should've let you know
All the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat
And make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing
And come over here to say
I'm looking good
But by the way
You still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
If you ever wondered
Still got the same old number; just in case
I still miss you
And i still love you
By the way, ohAny day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're gonna be
You say, this crazy world's come undone
Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today
Everyday now they're talking war
& I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well thats good enough for me
Dont need the real thing
Thats just another thing
For me to try to tame
Dont know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see me
Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But Ill never look
At a sunset the same night
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
Youll see meI'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly
But I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe
Baby you showed me what living is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
Oh oh
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
Crazier, crazier.Ive been counting days and
Ive been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above
I dont want to jinx my luck
Ive left it all behind me
And Ive been hoping every day
That someday you will find me
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
Dreaming of you baby
Ive been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
Cause Ive been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you
Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if youve seen one
Id like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one
I cross my heart and hope for you tonightHe said, "I got me a nice new apartment
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with."
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee
He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,
She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note
In dark blue TennesseeShe walks to school with her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o'clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried
Didn't she call you?
Didn't she need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too
He kissed his wife good bye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle three men walked and said,
"We're here to die for our God."
He stood up and said, "That's funny,
'Cause my God died for me."
I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
Didn't he call you?
Didn't he need you bad enough?
Did you not write it down?
Where were you?
And didn't he pray too?
The taxis pulled up on the very day of
They rode 100 floors up just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the towers up in flames
There was nothing left to say when it all came down
And didn't they call you?
Didn't they need you bad enough?
Where were you? Where were you?
And didn't they pray too?
I walk to school and I wear a cross
I'm counting every dayMy momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you
He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I wanna do is say
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said
Don't turn away now
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eyeHere in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me
When we started home it started to rain
You put your coat around me
We stood there in the road
You held me so close
But did you ever let go
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we couldve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
In through the window I see her with you
Im soaked to the skin, youre warm and dry
I guess the storm is over for you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
I just stood there like a ghost
As you held her so close
And as I let you go
Love like this changes who you are
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
All I need is to move on fast
But all I want is to have you back
And it just keeps falling
Down came the rain[Spoken:] You know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?
Well now he's back in the atmosphere
With Drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey
Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
That heaven is overrated
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
Well now he's back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet
Head back toward the Milky Way
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?
Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh ohhh
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong.
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes
Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
(Keep your eyes open [4x])
Keep your ey-eyes openIsn't it funny how many times we can say,
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page,
And moved on
That's what we thought
But here I am in the same old car,
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Uh oh, uh oh,
I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you
You always let someone come in between
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time
I won't tell my friend
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
And we'll tell each other things, like I love you
There are people who you come back to
So fall back on me,
Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
But just, baby, get along with me
There are people that you come back too
Fall back on me
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me baby,
Fall back on youSomeone struck a match against the night,
All I could see was you and I.
I was captivated.
A perfect little dream inside my head,
And then reality crept in, and erased it.
For a while I thought that I could hold you,
But you were just a temporary high.
Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly
Something so beautiful and free,
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand,
I tried to catch you, but I can't
Chase the wind
And just as I reach out to touch you,
I remind myself you were meant to fly.
I wish I could keep you firefly
I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough
Firefly you drew me to you
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you
I wish I could keep you,  firefly
FireflyMy name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kinda scared 'cause
I never been on a plane
My mama says that it'll be alright
'Cause I'm gunna see my daddy tonight
And she says that
There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
An' I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do
My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
She's finally well enough to travel
doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year
And there's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
But none of us want to get there too soon
James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we doWish I had concentrated,
They said love was complicated,
But it's something i just fell into,
And it was over-rated
But just look what i've created
I came out alive but i'm black and blue-ue
Before you ask me if i'm alright,
Think about what i,
Had to do-oo, yeah
Wake up and smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess i didn't plan,
And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me,
Wish you could only see,
I've got an i heart question mark,
Written on the back of my hand.
I'd be fine if you just walked by,
But you had to talk about why,
You were wrong and i was right,
But i can't believe you made me,
Sit at home and cry like a baby,
Wait right by the phone every night,
And now you ask about you and i,
There's no you and i,
Remember what you put me through,
I had to,
Wake up and smell the break-up,
Fix my heart put on my make-up,
And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me
I wish you'd could only see
I got an i heart question mark,
Written on the back of my hand
And when you're home alone at night,
You'll still wonder
Why you took everything i had, oh baby
I had a lot about you and i,
And i know,
Someday you will...
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planed,
And you'll know you didn't beat me,
When you look down and see,
I've got an i heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand,
An i heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand[Taylor Swift:]
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm)
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] I told you I was, I was) trouble, trouble, trouble
Double platinum wherever she go
South of France to Reno
Met her out in Vegas
Went in on casino
Red lips so hard to miss
What's wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad, bad things
If you into it
Don't need to get intimate...just yet
Slow down, I know that
You thinking you and me...just met
But girl, I got the remedy most important in chemistry
Good girl gone bad too much for a Kennedy
Some say, some say, they sell they souls for a couple hits
I'd rather live a life of gold with a perfect chick
Cause that one moment when your breathless and your hoping
And ya feel the same way, same way
Sparks blowing off that cute face and that shy smile...oh man
I haven't crushed this hard in quite a while...oh damn
And I can care less that your famous
We can make the perfect couple
Cause my first name big, last name trouble
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
Trouble, trouble, troubleI like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream
I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see
Dont try me
Dont fight me
You be you and Ill be me
They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you
Your mum and daddys walls
Are covered up in pictures of you
You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into
So sorry, dont worry
Im sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do
And it aint you oh
Oh baby, dont persuade me
I know that you aint used to no
So let me say it real slow
What I wanted, its true
I get what I want
And they say Ive always known
And youll will find out
And it aint youI... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight
You... you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please don't leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light
Oh let me think I'm strong
Please don't bring me down
I need you tonight
I... I used to fly
'Cause I'd seen the skyThrowing pennies at the fountain,
When you're standing on a mountain,
It's kinda hard to aim.
But like the trees we cut our names in,
There must be an explanation,
Guess it didn't given off rain.
I need reasons why you're leaving
Well I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought was a star,
I guess what you wrote on a paper
Wasn't really from your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
And I thought was a star.
Diving off into the deep end,
Honestly believe you'd be there,
When I jumped in,
Is ain't your territory,
We had the perfect love story,
except ending.
Nothing comes true,
When it comes to you.
And I thought it was a star.
And I was too cloudy,
It's not my fault I just couldn't see.
I thought it was a star,
Wasn't really in your heart
Throwing pennies at the fountain,
It's kinda hard to aim.I dont think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
Hell never fall in love he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
Im laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs
And...
I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him,
Id lie
He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldnt a light go on?
Doesnt he know that Ive had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I dont let nobody see me wishing he was mine
He stands there, then walks away
My god if I could only say,
"Im holding every breath for you..."
Hed never tell you but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is "My god, hes beautiful."
So I put on my make-up
And pray for a miracle
Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
Id lieShe didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
