The battle that we swore
We'd never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you
He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I wanna do is say
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said
Don't turn away now
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eyeHere in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me
When we started home it started to rain
You put your coat around me
We stood there in the road
You held me so close
But did you ever let go
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we couldve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
In through the window I see her with you
Im soaked to the skin, youre warm and dry
I guess the storm is over for you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
I just stood there like a ghost
As you held her so close
And as I let you go
Love like this changes who you are
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
All I need is to move on fast
But all I want is to have you back
And it just keeps falling
Down came the rain[Spoken:] You know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?
Well now he's back in the atmosphere
With Drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey
Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
That heaven is overrated
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
Well now he's back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet
Head back toward the Milky Way
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?
Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh ohhh
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong.
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes
Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
(Keep your eyes open [4x])
Keep your ey-eyes openIsn't it funny how many times we can say,
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page,
And moved on
That's what we thought
But here I am in the same old car,
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Uh oh, uh oh,
I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you
You always let someone come in between
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time
I won't tell my friend
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
And we'll tell each other things, like I love you
There are people who you come back to
So fall back on me,
Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
But just, baby, get along with me
There are people that you come back too
Fall back on me
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me baby,
Fall back on youSomeone struck a match against the night,
All I could see was you and I.
I was captivated.
A perfect little dream inside my head,
And then reality crept in, and erased it.
For a while I thought that I could hold you,
But you were just a temporary high.
Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly
Something so beautiful and free,
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand,
I tried to catch you, but I can't
Chase the wind
And just as I reach out to touch you,
I remind myself you were meant to fly.
I wish I could keep you firefly
I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough
Firefly you drew me to you
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you
I wish I could keep you,  firefly
FireflyMy name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kinda scared 'cause
I never been on a plane
My mama says that it'll be alright
'Cause I'm gunna see my daddy tonight
And she says that
There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
An' I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do
My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
She's finally well enough to travel
doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year
And there's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
But none of us want to get there too soon
James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we doWish I had concentrated,
They said love was complicated,
But it's something i just fell into,
And it was over-rated
But just look what i've created
I came out alive but i'm black and blue-ue
Before you ask me if i'm alright,
Think about what i,
Had to do-oo, yeah
Wake up and smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess i didn't plan,
And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me,
Wish you could only see,
I've got an i heart question mark,
Written on the back of my hand.
I'd be fine if you just walked by,
But you had to talk about why,
You were wrong and i was right,
But i can't believe you made me,
Sit at home and cry like a baby,
Wait right by the phone every night,
And now you ask about you and i,
There's no you and i,
Remember what you put me through,
I had to,
Wake up and smell the break-up,
Fix my heart put on my make-up,
And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me
I wish you'd could only see
I got an i heart question mark,
Written on the back of my hand
And when you're home alone at night,
You'll still wonder
Why you took everything i had, oh baby
I had a lot about you and i,
And i know,
Someday you will...
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planed,
And you'll know you didn't beat me,
When you look down and see,
I've got an i heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand,
An i heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand[Taylor Swift:]
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm)
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] I told you I was, I was) trouble, trouble, trouble
Double platinum wherever she go
South of France to Reno
Met her out in Vegas
Went in on casino
Red lips so hard to miss
What's wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad, bad things
If you into it
Don't need to get intimate...just yet
Slow down, I know that
You thinking you and me...just met
But girl, I got the remedy most important in chemistry
Good girl gone bad too much for a Kennedy
Some say, some say, they sell they souls for a couple hits
I'd rather live a life of gold with a perfect chick
Cause that one moment when your breathless and your hoping
And ya feel the same way, same way
Sparks blowing off that cute face and that shy smile...oh man
I haven't crushed this hard in quite a while...oh damn
And I can care less that your famous
We can make the perfect couple
Cause my first name big, last name trouble
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
Trouble, trouble, troubleI like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream
I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see
Dont try me
Dont fight me
You be you and Ill be me
They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you
Your mum and daddys walls
Are covered up in pictures of you
You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into
So sorry, dont worry
Im sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do
And it aint you oh
Oh baby, dont persuade me
I know that you aint used to no
So let me say it real slow
What I wanted, its true
I get what I want
And they say Ive always known
And youll will find out
And it aint youI... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight
You... you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please don't leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light
Oh let me think I'm strong
Please don't bring me down
I need you tonight
I... I used to fly
'Cause I'd seen the skyThrowing pennies at the fountain,
When you're standing on a mountain,
It's kinda hard to aim.
But like the trees we cut our names in,
There must be an explanation,
Guess it didn't given off rain.
I need reasons why you're leaving
Well I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought was a star,
I guess what you wrote on a paper
Wasn't really from your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
And I thought was a star.
Diving off into the deep end,
Honestly believe you'd be there,
When I jumped in,
Is ain't your territory,
We had the perfect love story,
except ending.
Nothing comes true,
When it comes to you.
And I thought it was a star.
And I was too cloudy,
It's not my fault I just couldn't see.
I thought it was a star,
Wasn't really in your heart
Throwing pennies at the fountain,
It's kinda hard to aim.I dont think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
Hell never fall in love he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
Im laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs
And...
I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him,
Id lie
He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldnt a light go on?
Doesnt he know that Ive had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I dont let nobody see me wishing he was mine
He stands there, then walks away
My god if I could only say,
"Im holding every breath for you..."
Hed never tell you but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is "My god, hes beautiful."
So I put on my make-up
And pray for a miracle
Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
Id lieShe didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why
I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, cos she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough
That's where I'm headed right now
I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there
But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
I just drive on by
I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night, just south of knowing whyI got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it'd be a long time going
They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going
I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you
A long time going
And it will be a long time, long time going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
It will be a long time, long time going, going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ohCome on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose
Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside
He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine
I never talked about the nights he called
I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind
Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went outThere's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You could do better, that's what she says
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you
She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, that's what she says
And she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you
Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey she'll love you, funny how some view
Angels above you ain't so far away
And she says lucky you, lucky youYour feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You
You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got
I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good
Made Up You
Made Up YouHe's got a nice little life
He's gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
It's not the best I know
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine
People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin
Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah
Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh, mandolinMe and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney
We were babies, we were beautiful and free
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney
She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasnt been the same since
That boy she went ran off with, well I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney
She was in love, she was beautiful and free
She was always so much braver than me
When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said Im sorry for waking you up but I didnt know who else to call
Or where else to go
Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney
Were not as young, but were still beautiful and free
Even when were old, were still gonna be
Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear in the summer shadeI like glitter and sparkly dresses,
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter,
La la la, la la la
I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me,
But I'm not gonna say that
I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public,
La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue
You might think I'd bring up Joe,
The guy who broke up with me on the phone,
But I'm not gonna mention him
Hey Joe! I'm doing real well,
Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not gonna brag about that
La la la, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
And if you're wondering if I might,
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight,
(Hi Taylor!)
I'm not gonna comment on that
You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue.....
But there's nothing more to say
Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining this stage
This is my SNL monologue
That was my SNL monologueI know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better
All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you
If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
if you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure
wherever you think I am tonight
just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby
sometime along the way you take my breath away
distracted by he view
I fall right into you
and if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure
they say I need to see all the people out there waiting
but you take one look at me
and I know the mistake I'd be making
cuz if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure
I know we've got a lot to say between now and foreverSomething about me didn't fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I haven't read it a thousand times
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me
You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
She'll still sing the same old songs
Turned on that radio
Hey that's when I realized
It wasn't our song, it was yours
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than
It's my turn to be meOn a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, it's quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by
You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress
Blowing through a mountain
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July
And its safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you
Thinking bout the whole thing
Blowing though a valley
I'm going back to Nashville
Blowing through the valley
Going back to Naaaaahh....
What's the use of wondering why?I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called
I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My worlds a little colder now
But Im keeping warm somehow
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you
I dont need you dont need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street
You need me now
Thats what youve been telling my friends
That Ive come too far to go back there again
My heart my mind and number have changed
You might as well forget my name
I dont need you dont need you
Red letters that I wrote on the wall
So whos gonna hold you
I dont need you now
And I dont know where you are
I dont wonder where you are
I dont dream about you cause I dont need you now
I dont dream about the way
That I never heard you say
I need you I need you
Dont need you
Dont need you nowI think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade
Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now that's broken too
Everybody else was everything to you
You think everybody wants a fight
I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
You've seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do
Never fadeLook at you
Look at me
Look at who we could be
I wanna know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you
And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind
All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you
And look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
All I really wanna say is I need you, babe
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
And I just wish I told you never mind
And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
Yeah, oh yeah
I could tell you now but never mind
Yeah, oh yeah yeah
And I could tell you now but never mindIt wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
When there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I, I still love you but I can't
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah
The picture frame is empty
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
I was so sure of everything we thought we'd always have
I'm lost in the sound of it
But here in the now comes in
Seems like I'm becoming part of your past
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you like your slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah
There was one thing I knew would never leave me
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skinStanding on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again
And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can
Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind
Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out
Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everythingOh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was fallin'
You were holdin' my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I coulda spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were callin my name
When your face faded from view
Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin" out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night
I remember waking up with you
The days doin' nothin'
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you
Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?
And stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises you made on Our last night?
Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like harold and martin singing
I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane
Was it just like the promises that we made?
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
Oh,oh,oh,whoa,whoa,yeaah, ohI know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
'cause I'm not trying to show maturity
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker
I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess
He found 30 other pieces
But he'll never find them all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall
And I don't appreciate you calling him to reminisce
The only reason is you're seeing how much better off he is
To write on his heart
Oh, permanent markerI could've keyed your car
I could've rolled your yard
I know the passwords to your emails, everything you do
I could've put 'em to good use
But I'm dressed to kill and tonight I'm going out on a date
With your best friend, he always liked me anyway
R-E-V-E-N-G-E My list of things to do this week
Jealousy, misery, gonna give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so B-A-D
Break you, make you sorry
I hope you cry getting my R-E-V-E-N-G-E
So I'm gonna paint the town with him
Replace your memory, everywhere we've ever been
I don't hangout at smokey bars but I know we'll see you there
And I'm making you hear me laugh like I just don't care
I know you hate my friends so tonight I called 'em all
Later on you can expect some prank phone calls, baby
S-A-N-I-T-Y, I hope you lose yours tonight
You made me crazy too long
So I'm working on
Baby, baby R-E-V-E-N-G-E
Gonna give you what you gave to meI was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams
Oh, and they come unstuck
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf
I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
Oh lady, running down to the riptide
I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrongI remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear
Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?
I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and backI remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Don't you dare look out your window darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
La La (La La)
Come morning light,
You and I'll be safe and sound...
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh oh ohLet's watch
The tide chase
The waves
Onto the sand
I wonder
If a broken heart
Feel the warmth
On my hand
And I wonder
What a piece
Of driftwood
Has seen all through
His lifetime
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights
I've seen
A million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want
To speak to you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights
Still throught
The haze
I can make out
Constellations
