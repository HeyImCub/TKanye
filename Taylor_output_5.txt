I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said "my point exactly"
And later on that night, under the neon city lights,
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me.
You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring
And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
'Cause they don't play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
'Til Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah, oh oh
Until Brad Pitt comes alongToday was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense until the time I saw your face
Yeah yeah
But can you feel this magic in the air?
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Today was a fairytaleAre you trying to make me fall
'Cause with a face like that baby
It won't take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while I'll be hypnotized
Sitting here singing
Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head
Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up
I was all caught up
'Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me
See the train is coming for me
Help me, save me from this crash at last
Na na na na na na na na na
You seem to be just what I've tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Ooh, ooh I really really want you
Oh, oh I love you I love you
Oh, oh..
Trying to get my heels back under my headI used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemys eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!
One minute I held the keys
Next the doors were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I cant explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldnt believe what Id become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king?
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
But that was when I ruled the worldIf you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me
If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
You'd be with me, so baby
Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me
It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall
But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby
You go, I hope you think of me
This girl is begging wait, wait for me
We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to
So don't you look in my eyes
Don't you look now
Don't you look nowWe used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy
I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And Goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy
Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
We Were Happy
And you were gonna marry me
When we were happy
Yeah, We were were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We Were happyI got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy
When I let too much go
Loves a little messy and you are too
Right now Im scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasnt gonna stray
Swore Id never let a man in my way
Youre the last thing I needed today
And I dont know
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Gone and spilled my coffee
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Cant talk to my friends
Without you coming up
Its even kind of cute
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good
Right next to mine
Youre the last thing I needed tonight
Welcome distraction
Im acting like a girl
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring
About anything but you
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh ohWhat do you say, when you just know
That he's the one, and you wanna go fast
But he's taking it slow
And what do you do, when he's next to you
But he's a little bit shy
Well here's something you can try
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?
What do you see, when you look in his eyes
There's something there
That he can't disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel, when you know its real
And you can't sit still
If you don't own up will yeah
My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say
What do you say?She's looking in the mirror
The moment's getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk
School dance, first chance
Always been a dreamer
There's one guy, she's shy
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it
Blue dress, angel face
Looking in the mirror
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air
Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear
She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
She's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life
First date, can't wait
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's looking right at her
Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt
The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
Move out, find out
Where the world can take her
Bright lights, late nights
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer
Ohh, oh, oh
Wondering what to wearYou walk in here with your guitar man
Your shining boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you've got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands
But don't ruin yourself I ain't your competition
Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention
I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been
I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words i wrote down on a page,
When i was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues,
I tell them, "this is what I do"
And its what i put my life into,
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume
And say life on musical road is rough conditions
But the easy ride was never my ambition
Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games
So what have you got that I ain't?
And what can you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you wanna be, girl, and who I've always beenI can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why did you have to look so good?
Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you
I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds
And if you ever change your mind
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in
That I'm really ok cause I'm not
I'll just wait for the day
I stop pretending
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Till I do,
I'll keep writing songs about youI bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything
If you want hard to get
If you want...
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one'll be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes
It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
but for someone like you it's just so easy to do
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room
And i know that if i turn around you won't be there
If i close my eyes will you be there?
I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face
I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And i hope it never falls
And i hope i never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now i wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?
That girl in the song had it so good
I wish i could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And i had you
